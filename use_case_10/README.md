## Setup & installation

### Requirements

This use case relies on the following frameworks/libraries:
<br></br>

**Software & Frameworks**

* **Python 3.10**: Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
* **OpenAI API**: Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).
* **BING Search API**: Obtain an API key from [Azure](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

<br></br>
**Python Packages**

Install the necessary packages with:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Regxelerator/solutions-use-case-library.git
```

2. Change the directory to the specific use case.
```sh
cd use_case_10
```

3. Enter your OpenAI API in `.env`
```sh
OPEN_API_KEY='ENTER YOUR API Key'
BING_API_KEY='ENTER YOUR API Key'
```

4. Populate the template in the folder ```entity_files``` in the ```input``` directory with entity-specific information. Relabel the template with the entity name.

## Disclaimer

The approaches and techniques illustrated in this use case are intended to demonstrate potential applications of generative AI in financial supervision and regulation. They represent one of several possible methods and are not intended to prescribe best practices or comprehensive solutions. Adaptation and refinement will be necessary to align with specific supervisory objectives, regulatory frameworks, and data environments. Limitations in scope, data, or methodology may apply for demonstration purposes. Users are encouraged to consider additional steps - such as data preprocessing, contextual enrichment, and validation workflows - as appropriate to their own use cases and to optimize the workflows for production.
